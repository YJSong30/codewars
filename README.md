# Codewars

Welcome to my **Codewars** repository! This is a collection of solutions to various coding challenges on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), showcasing my problem-solving skills, proficiency in JavaScript, and testing abilities with Jest.

## Features

- **Language**: Currently, the solutions are implemented in **JavaScript**, with plans to add **Python** solutions in the future.
- **Testing**: All JavaScript solutions are tested using **Jest** to ensure correctness and edge case handling.
- **Documentation**: Each solution includes **JSDoc** of description and inputs/outputs.

## Repository Structure

You can find my solutions in [`js_files`](./js_files) and see the tests in [`jest`](./jest)
